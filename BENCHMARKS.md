# Lane A measurements

Phase 1 is in progress. No candidate has passed all four gates yet.

## Reference and gates

- Existing baseline: **qwen3:8b, 19.48 tok/s**, prompt evaluation 100 tok/s,
  load 4.1 s, measured 2026-09-06. It has not been re-measured.
- Gate (a): generation throughput **>15 tok/s**; also compare against 19.48 tok/s.
- Gate (b): routing **>=18/20**. Gate (c): callable tool JSON **20/20**.
- Gate (d): record peak RAM and system memory pressure during **ten minutes** of load.
- Host: Mac mini M4, 10 CPU / 10 GPU cores, 24 GiB RAM, wired limit 20480 MB.
  Free disk before download: 253.63 GB. Before the first run, system free-memory
  percentage was 66% and pre-existing swap usage was 2975.94 MiB.

## Candidate 1: Qwen3.8-Flash-Next

Model: `unsloth/Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-GGUF`, revision
`38bb39ee97821de2c9009abb7e93950eec396e66`, `UD-IQ4_XS`.
Three GGUF shards total **93,682,584,224 bytes**; each size and SHA-256 was
verified against Hugging Face metadata. Download took approximately 56 minutes.
Weights are stored locally under `models/qwen3.8-flash-next/UD-IQ4_XS/`, excluded from Git.

Runtime: upstream llama.cpp **b10809**, commit
`5266f24da75dc449bd56cbed7addb9c8e4a6a73e`, the binary referenced by stable v0.4.0.
The installed Homebrew b10360 predates this model's architecture support.
The [arm64 runtime archive](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/releases/download/b10809/llama-b10809-bin-macos-arm64.tar.gz)
was size- and SHA-256-verified: 11,123,196 bytes,
`7d692df9e1e386e62f1c12b843903218041e6cd74c9415aa39a7ed3176f9eaa2`.
Runtime lives under `.tools/llama-b10809/llama-b10809/`, excluded from Git.

Prompt: "Explain how a local command-line assistant can keep useful project memory
while limiting retrieved context. Give a clear practical answer."

Common flags:

| Run | GPU layers | Batch / ubatch | Result | Elapsed | Maximum RSS |
|---|---:|---:|---|---:|---:|
| 1 | all | 128 / 128 | Metal OOM before valid generation | 77.62 s | 7,937,196,032 bytes |
| 2 | 8 | 32 / 32 | **0.21 tok/s — FAIL gate (a)** | 703.24 s | 14,425,473,024 bytes |

Run 1 exact errors:

```text
Insufficient Memory (00000008:kIOGPUCommandBufferCallbackErrorOutOfMemory)
llama_decode: failed to decode, ret = -3
Compute error.
```

**Run 1 exited 0 despite the compute errors. It is a failed run, with no valid
tok/s measurement.** A successful process exit alone is insufficient for this runtime.
The 78-second failed run does not satisfy gate (d).
Raw stdout, stderr and exit statuses are retained in `.session/flash-next-throughput.*`
and `.session/flash-next-retry.*` locally.

The first runtime archive transfer also failed with
`http.client.IncompleteRead: IncompleteRead(8189970 bytes read, 2933226 more expected)`.
A curl retry recovered it and passed the full size/hash check before extraction.

Run 2 completed 128 generated tokens in 600,408.85 ms; llama.cpp reports **0.21 tok/s**.
Prompt evaluation: 76 tokens in 60,105.95 ms, **1.26 tok/s**. No compute error occurred.
This fails both the >15 tok/s gate and the 19.48 tok/s reference. Routing and tool gates
were skipped as instructed after gate (a) failed. Although the run lasted 703.24 seconds,
it was not a continuously sampled ten-minute memory-pressure test; gate (d) is unmeasured.
No Lane A winner or recall score is claimed.

## Candidate 2: Qwen3.8-27B + CMoE

**Unsupported as specified; not downloaded or benchmarked.** No verified converted
Qwen3.8-27B checkpoint or compatible Metal runtime was found. This is an availability
blocker, not a measured 0 tok/s result.

At official [CMoE revision 42dfc947](https://github.com/JarvisPei/CMoE/tree/42dfc94777a0de3620a67bdb5000d7fec56e5b6a):

- `run_cmoe.py` loads Llama/Llava classes, requires CUDA and assumes `model.model.layers`.
- `CMoE_utils.py` calls self-attention in every layer. Qwen3.8-27B's
  [configuration](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3.8-27B/blob/main/config.json)
  uses `Qwen3_5ForConditionalGeneration` with hybrid linear/full attention.
- `CMoE_model.py` implements a custom two-projection router. Upstream b10809's
  Qwen35 MoE graph cannot reproduce it simply by renaming or exporting tensors.
- The repository provides no GGUF exporter or Metal implementation. Its documented
  zero-sample route also conflicts with an `inps[0]` access and unconditional
  fine-tuning call in the published runner; these are source findings, not executed errors.

A dense, unconverted Qwen or a differently trained MoE would not be this candidate.
