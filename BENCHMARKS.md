- Gate (b): routing **>=18/20**. Gate (c): callable tool JSON **20/20**.
- Gate (d): record peak RAM and system memory pressure during **ten minutes** of load.
- Host: Mac mini M4, 10 CPU / 10 GPU cores, 24 GiB RAM, wired limit 20480 MB.
  Free disk before download: 253.63 GB. Before the first run, system free-memory
  percentage was 66% and pre-existing swap usage was 2975.94 MiB.

## Candidate 1: Qwen3.8-Flash-Next

Model: `unsloth/Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-GGUF`, revision
`38bb39ee97821de2c9009abb7e93950eec396e66`, `UD-IQ4_XS`.
Three GGUF shards total **93,682,584,224 bytes**; each size and SHA-256 was
verified against Hugging Face metadata. Download took approximately 56 minutes.
Weights are stored locally under `models/qwen3.8-flash-next/UD-IQ4_XS/`, excluded from Git.

Runtime: upstream llama.cpp **b10809**, commit
`5266f24da75dc449bd56cbed7addb9c8e4a6a73e`, the binary referenced by stable v0.4.0.
The installed Homebrew b10360 predates this model's architecture support.
The [arm64 runtime archive](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/releases/download/b10809/llama-b10809-bin-macos-arm64.tar.gz)
was size- and SHA-256-verified: 11,123,196 bytes,
`7d692df9e1e386e62f1c12b843903218041e6cd74c9415aa39a7ed3176f9eaa2`.
Runtime lives under `.tools/llama-b10809/llama-b10809/`, excluded from Git.

Prompt: "Explain how a local command-line assistant can keep useful project memory
while limiting retrieved context. Give a clear practical answer."

Common flags:

```sh
-lm mmap --lazy-mode on --cpu-moe --no-repack --no-op-offload \
-c 4096 -t 8 -ctk q8_0 -ctv q8_0 -fa on --offline --no-warmup \
--perf -n 128 --seed 42 --temp 0 --simple-io --single-turn
```

| Run | GPU layers | Batch / ubatch | Result | Elapsed | Maximum RSS |
|---|---:|---:|---|---:|---:|
| 1 | all | 128 / 128 | Metal OOM before valid generation | 77.62 s | 7,937,196,032 bytes |
| 2 | 8 | 32 / 32 | **0.21 tok/s — FAIL gate (a)** | 703.24 s | 14,425,473,024 bytes |

Run 1 exact errors:

```text
Insufficient Memory (00000008:kIOGPUCommandBufferCallbackErrorOutOfMemory)
llama_decode: failed to decode, ret = -3
Compute error.
```

**Run 1 exited 0 despite the compute errors. It is a failed run, with no valid
tok/s measurement.** A successful process exit alone is insufficient for this runtime.
The 78-second failed run does not satisfy gate (d).
Raw stdout, stderr and exit statuses are retained in `.session/flash-next-throughput.*`
and `.session/flash-next-retry.*` locally.

The first runtime archive transfer also failed with
`http.client.IncompleteRead: IncompleteRead(8189970 bytes read, 2933226 more expected)`.
A curl retry recovered it and passed the full size/hash check before extraction.

Run 2 completed 128 generated tokens in 600,408.85 ms; llama.cpp reports **0.21 tok/s**.
Prompt evaluation: 76 tokens in 60,105.95 ms, **1.26 tok/s**. No compute error occurred.
This fails both the >15 tok/s gate and the 19.48 tok/s reference. Routing and tool gates
were skipped as instructed after gate (a) failed. Although the run lasted 703.24 seconds,
it was not a continuously sampled ten-minute memory-pressure test; gate (d) is unmeasured.
No Lane A winner or recall score is claimed.

## Candidate 2: Qwen3.8-27B + CMoE

**Unsupported as specified; not downloaded or benchmarked.** No verified converted
Qwen3.8-27B checkpoint or compatible Metal runtime was found. This is an availability
blocker, not a measured 0 tok/s result.

At official [CMoE revision 42dfc947](https://github.com/JarvisPei/CMoE/tree/42dfc94777a0de3620a67bdb5000d7fec56e5b6a):

- `run_cmoe.py` loads Llama/Llava classes, requires CUDA and assumes `model.model.layers`.
- `CMoE_utils.py` calls self-attention in every layer. Qwen3.8-27B's
  [configuration](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3.8-27B/blob/main/config.json)
  uses `Qwen3_5ForConditionalGeneration` with hybrid linear/full attention.
- `CMoE_model.py` implements a custom two-projection router. Upstream b10809's
  Qwen35 MoE graph cannot reproduce it simply by renaming or exporting tensors.
- The repository provides no GGUF exporter or Metal implementation. Its documented
  zero-sample route also conflicts with an `inps[0]` access and unconditional
  fine-tuning call in the published runner; these are source findings, not executed errors.

A dense, unconverted Qwen or a differently trained MoE would not be this candidate.


## Candidate 3: Gemma 4 26B-A4B

**Download in progress; all four gates unmeasured.** Ordered fallback after candidate 1's
measured speed failure and candidate 2's implementation blocker.

- Official model: [google/gemma-4-26B-A4B-it](https://huggingface.co/google/gemma-4-26B-A4B-it),
  revision `4d7ae4984b7db7de8f8457170b3f1a419ee76d52`; Apache-2.0 in the current official card.
- Quantization: [unsloth/gemma-4-26B-A4B-it-GGUF](https://huggingface.co/unsloth/gemma-4-26B-A4B-it-GGUF/tree/c099eb48e663fd284577b04978a94ffccb261841),
  revision `c099eb48e663fd284577b04978a94ffccb261841`.
- File: `gemma-4-26B-A4B-it-UD-IQ4_XS.gguf`, **13,597,177,568 bytes**.
  Expected SHA-256: `babd1e389d386352f71600765d37390f7dc993fbfad6725caccf996ffe34aecf`.
- Same b10809 runtime; intended flags: `-lm mmap -ngl 99 -fa on -ctk q8_0 -ctv q8_0
  -np 1 -c 4096 -t 8 --jinja --reasoning off --offline --perf`.
  Context is capped at 4,096 for these gates; larger contexts are not certified by this run.

### Frozen quality and RAM protocol

`bench_cases.json` contains 20 routing requests and 20 synthetic tool requests. Its SHA-256 is
`fdcf669576169038916ba421e097ba9fee3854aae01873c5b6e6f25287e3e86d`.
The referenced prompt set was absent from Task 2, so these cases were created and frozen before
seeing any candidate's quality output. They sample the plan's skill/lane policy; they do not
certify every skill in the research taxonomy. No synthetic function is executed.

`benchmark.py` evaluates the model plus llama.cpp's native tool parser and strict function
schemas through its local HTTP API. Valid tool JSON and exact intended arguments are reported
separately. Routing requires exact skill/lane JSON; requests use temperature 0 and seed 42.
The RAM gate maintains generation load for at least 600 seconds and samples process RSS,
system pressure and free-memory percentage every five seconds. Pass criterion set before the
run: pressure remains normal and system free-memory percentage stays at least 10%.
The sampled RSS maximum is labeled as such; `/usr/bin/time -l` additionally records the
server's process high-water RSS after shutdown.

```sh
.venv/bin/python benchmark.py speed --output .session/gemma-speed.json
.venv/bin/python benchmark.py quality --output .session/gemma-quality.json
.venv/bin/python benchmark.py soak --pid SERVER_PID --output .session/gemma-soak.json
```
